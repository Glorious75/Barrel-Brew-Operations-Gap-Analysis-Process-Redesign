# 🔍 Project Overview

Barrel & Brew is a fast-growing craft winery with over 500 active restaurant clients. While revenue has increased, the business faces operational disruptions, quality inconsistencies, 
and employee overload. This case study applies gap analysis, root cause investigation, and process mapping to uncover bottlenecks and provide scalable improvements.

I analyzed current operations, aligned them with leadership’s desired future state, and developed actionable recommendations supported by process maps, swimlane diagrams, and root-cause modeling
