# 🔍 Project Overview

Barrel & Brew is a fast-growing craft winery with over 500 active restaurant clients. While revenue has increased, the business faces operational disruptions, quality inconsistencies, 
and employee overload. This case study applies gap analysis, root cause investigation, and process mapping to uncover bottlenecks and provide scalable improvements.

I analyzed current operations, aligned them with leadership’s desired future state, and developed actionable recommendations supported by process maps, swimlane diagrams, and root-cause modeling

# 🏭 Business Background

Barrel & Brew has built a strong brand around artisanal small-batch wine. However, increased market demand has pushed existing infrastructure and processes beyond capacity.

## Challenges identified:

- Production delays and missed delivery timelines

- Batch-to-batch quality inconsistencies

- Manual recording of fermentation and recipe notes

- Ingredient/material waste

- Employee burnout and ineffective task distribution

- Maintenance gaps in aging brewing and bottling equipment

- No structured demand forecasting or data system

These challenges directly impact scalability and long-term business sustainability.

# 🎯 Objectives

- Map the end-to-end current-state brewing process

- Identify bottlenecks affecting quality, production, and reliability

- Categorize causes using a Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram

- Design an efficient future-state workflow with clear role boundaries

- Recommend actionable improvements aligned with growth goals

# 📊 Analysis Performed

## Gap Analysis — Barrel & Brew Operations

| **Focus Area** | **Current State** | **Gap Identified** | **Future State** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Production Processes** | Manual brewing workflow with handwritten recipe logs | Slow production, repeated errors, quality inconsistency | Standardized digital workflow with automated batch tracking and SOPs |
| **Quality Control** | QC happens only at the end of production | Defects found late → rework, delays, customer impact | Stage-based QC checkpoints at fermentation, bottling, and packaging |
| **Equipment Reliability** | Aging tanks and frequent bottling-line failures | High downtime and cascading delays | Preventive maintenance plan and phased equipment upgrades |
| **Demand Forecasting** | Forecasting based on assumptions and gut feel | Over/underproduction and wasted resources | Data-driven forecasting using distributor sales and historical trends |
| **Inventory Management** | Ingredient stock tracked manually | Stockouts, spoilage, inconsistent batch quality | Integrated inventory system linked to production and consumption |
| **Workforce Allocation** | Overworked team, unclear responsibilities | Employee burnout and inconsistent performance | Clear role assignments, balanced scheduling, and training |
| **Communication & Alignment** | Sales and production operate in silos | Rush orders, misalignment, operational confusion | Weekly Sales–Production sync with shared visibility tools |
| **Data & Documentation** | Notes in notebooks and scattered spreadsheets | No audit trail, knowledge loss, high onboarding time | Centralized digital record of recipes, batches, QC checkpoints |
| **Scalability & Growth** | Processes designed for small-batch operations | Systems fail under increasing demand | Scalable production workflows supported by automation and KPIs |

## Current-State Process Mapping

![Barrel Brewy_Current process](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63393923-80a4-469d-a7c3-d91929cef5a7)

The production path was visually mapped from order intake to distribution: 

Recipe Planning → Ingredient Prep → Brewing → Fermentation → Quality Control → Bottling → Packaging → Delivery

### Critical friction points:

- Lost time rewriting handwritten notes

- Lack of checkpoints between brewing → Quality Checks → packaging

- No formal scheduling or task allocation

- Frequent rework due to inconsistent fermentation logs

- Equipment downtime cascading into bottling delays
  
## Future-State Swimlane Mapping

![Barrel brewy_Future Process flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/837d8c7e-fdd1-4ee8-a83c-1bf436ed8b4b)

The  redesigned workflow comprise of 5 Swimlane roles that shows accountability and automation:

- Sales Manager

- Brewing/Production Team

- Quality Control

- Bottling Team

- ERP/System

### Key improvements include:

- Digital recipe & batch records

- Sales-driven forecasting integrated into planning

- Preventive maintenance cycle

- Inventory synchronization with production

- Clear stage-based QC checkpoints

This ensures scalable production without compromising quality.

# ✨ Conclusion

The investigation into Barrel & Brew’s operations revealed that the company’s growing demand is outpacing its current workflows, tools, and organizational structure. While the product quality and brand reputation are strong, production inefficiencies, manual recordkeeping, siloed communication, and aging equipment are creating delays, inconsistencies, and employee burnout. These issues are systemic rather than isolated — rooted in the way the business operates rather than in single departments.

By mapping the end-to-end process and analyzing key pain points, it becomes clear that sustainable growth requires a shift toward digital tracking, cross-department alignment, and proactive planning. Rather than reacting to demand, Barrel & Brew must transition to a model where data drives decision-making, quality is standardized, and production capacity scales predictably.

# 💡 Recommendations 

- Digitize Production & Batch Records
Replace handwritten logs with digital recipe sheets, fermentation trackers, and batch reports.
This creates traceability, reduces errors, and improves quality consistency.

- Implement Stage-Based Quality Control
Introduce QC checkpoints at key production stages (brewing, fermentation, bottling).
Early detection prevents rework, delays, and product inconsistencies.

-  Adopt Data-Driven Demand Forecasting
Use historical distributor sales and seasonal trends to plan production volumes.
Aligning output with demand reduces waste, stockouts, and inventory risk.

-  Upgrade & Maintain Critical Equipment
Create a preventive maintenance plan and phase in upgrades for aging machinery.
Stable equipment reduces bottlenecks, improves throughput, and protects staff workload.

- Improve Cross-Team Communication and collaboration
Establish weekly Sales production alignment meetings and shared visibility tools.
This ensures operational clarity, reduces last minute disruptions, and supports planning.
