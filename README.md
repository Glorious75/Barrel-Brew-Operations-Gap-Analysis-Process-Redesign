# 🔍 Project Overview

Barrel & Brew is a fast-growing craft winery with over 500 active restaurant clients. While revenue has increased, the business faces operational disruptions, quality inconsistencies, 
and employee overload. This case study applies gap analysis, root cause investigation, and process mapping to uncover bottlenecks and provide scalable improvements.

I analyzed current operations, aligned them with leadership’s desired future state, and developed actionable recommendations supported by process maps, swimlane diagrams, and root-cause modeling

# 🏭 Business Background

Barrel & Brew has built a strong brand around artisanal small-batch wine. However, increased market demand has pushed existing infrastructure and processes beyond capacity.

## Challenges identified:

- Production delays and missed delivery timelines

- Batch-to-batch quality inconsistencies

- Manual recording of fermentation and recipe notes

- Ingredient/material waste

- Employee burnout and ineffective task distribution

- Maintenance gaps in aging brewing and bottling equipment

- No structured demand forecasting or data system

These challenges directly impact scalability and long-term business sustainability.

🎯 Objectives

- Map the end-to-end current-state brewing process

- Identify bottlenecks affecting quality, production, and reliability

- Categorize causes using a Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram

- Design an efficient future-state workflow with clear role boundaries

- Recommend actionable improvements aligned with growth goals

# 📉 Gap Analysis — Barrel & Brew Operations

| **Focus Area** | **Current State** | **Gap Identified** | **Future State** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Production Processes** | Manual brewing workflow with handwritten recipe logs | Slow production, repeated errors, quality inconsistency | Standardized digital workflow with automated batch tracking and SOPs |
| **Quality Control** | QC happens only at the end of production | Defects found late → rework, delays, customer impact | Stage-based QC checkpoints at fermentation, bottling, and packaging |
| **Equipment Reliability** | Aging tanks and frequent bottling-line failures | High downtime and cascading delays | Preventive maintenance plan and phased equipment upgrades |
| **Demand Forecasting** | Forecasting based on assumptions and gut feel | Over/underproduction and wasted resources | Data-driven forecasting using distributor sales and historical trends |
| **Inventory Management** | Ingredient stock tracked manually | Stockouts, spoilage, inconsistent batch quality | Integrated inventory system linked to production and consumption |
| **Workforce Allocation** | Overworked team, unclear responsibilities | Employee burnout and inconsistent performance | Clear role assignments, balanced scheduling, and training |
| **Communication & Alignment** | Sales and production operate in silos | Rush orders, misalignment, operational confusion | Weekly Sales–Production sync with shared visibility tools |
| **Data & Documentation** | Notes in notebooks and scattered spreadsheets | No audit trail, knowledge loss, high onboarding time | Centralized digital record of recipes, batches, QC checkpoints |
| **Scalability & Growth** | Processes designed for small-batch operations | Systems fail under increasing demand | Scalable production workflows supported by automation and KPIs |
