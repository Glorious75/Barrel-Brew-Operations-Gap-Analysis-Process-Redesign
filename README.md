# 🔍 Project Overview

Barrel & Brew is a fast-growing craft winery with over 500 active restaurant clients. While revenue has increased, the business faces operational disruptions, quality inconsistencies, 
and employee overload. This case study applies gap analysis, root cause investigation, and process mapping to uncover bottlenecks and provide scalable improvements.

I analyzed current operations, aligned them with leadership’s desired future state, and developed actionable recommendations supported by process maps, swimlane diagrams, and root-cause modeling

# 🏭 Business Background

Barrel & Brew has built a strong brand around artisanal small-batch wine. However, increased market demand has pushed existing infrastructure and processes beyond capacity.

## Challenges identified:

- Production delays and missed delivery timelines

- Batch-to-batch quality inconsistencies

- Manual recording of fermentation and recipe notes

- Ingredient/material waste

- Employee burnout and ineffective task distribution

- Maintenance gaps in aging brewing and bottling equipment

- No structured demand forecasting or data system

These challenges directly impact scalability and long-term business sustainability.
